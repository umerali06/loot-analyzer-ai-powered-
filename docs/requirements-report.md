# SIBI / Lot Analyser - Requirements Audit Report

**Generated:** 2025-01-27  
**Auditor:** Senior Full-Stack Engineer & QA Lead  
**Status:** In Progress - Critical Issues Identified

## Executive Summary

The SIBI / Lot Analyser project has a solid foundation but contains several critical issues that prevent it from being client-ready:

1. **CRITICAL:** Hardcoded API keys in environment files (Security Risk)
2. **CRITICAL:** eBay service uses mock/fallback data instead of real ScraperAPI integration
3. **HIGH:** Missing proper outlier filtering implementation
4. **MEDIUM:** Some components need TypeScript strict mode compliance
5. **LOW:** Missing comprehensive test coverage

## Requirements Matrix

| # | Requirement | Implemented? | Evidence | Gaps | Fix/Task |
|---|-------------|--------------|----------|------|----------|
| 1 | Image upload (single/multi) | ✅ Yes | `components/ImageUpload.tsx:1-50` | None | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | AI vision: item identification | ✅ Yes | `lib/ai-vision.ts:1-100` | None | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | eBay active listing counts | ❌ No | `lib/ebay-service.ts:200-250` | Uses mock data | 🔴 CRITICAL: Implement ScraperAPI |
| 4 | eBay recently sold counts | ❌ No | `lib/ebay-service.ts:250-300` | Uses mock data | 🔴 CRITICAL: Implement ScraperAPI |
| 5 | eBay sold prices → actual market value | ❌ No | `lib/ebay-service.ts:300-350` | Uses mock data | 🔴 CRITICAL: Implement ScraperAPI |
| 6 | GPT guestimate value calc | ✅ Yes | `lib/ai-vision.ts:300-350` | None | ✅ Complete |
| 7 | Outlier filtering | ⚠️ Partial | `lib/analysis-service.ts:400-450` | Basic IQR only | 🟡 HIGH: Implement comprehensive filtering |
| 8 | Interactive table + links | ✅ Yes | `components/AnalysisResults.tsx:1-50` | None | ✅ Complete |
| 9 | Summary view | ✅ Yes | `components/AnalysisResults.tsx:50-100` | None | ✅ Complete |
| 10 | No mock data, real-time DB | ❌ No | `lib/ebay-service.ts:350-400` | Extensive mock data | 🔴 CRITICAL: Remove all mock data |
| 11 | Vercel-ready zip build | ✅ Yes | `vercel.json:1-42` | None | ✅ Complete |
| 12 | Error handling & logging | ✅ Yes | `lib/logger.ts:1-50` | None | ✅ Complete |

## Critical Issues

### 1. Hardcoded API Keys (SECURITY RISK)
- **File:** `env.example`
- **Issue:** Contains actual API keys instead of placeholders
- **Risk:** High - API keys exposed in version control
- **Fix:** ✅ COMPLETED - Replaced with placeholders

### 2. eBay Service Mock Data (FUNCTIONALITY RISK)
- **File:** `lib/ebay-service.ts`
- **Issue:** Uses fallback/mock data instead of real ScraperAPI
- **Impact:** Client cannot get real market data
- **Fix:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Rewriting with ScraperAPI integration

### 3. Missing Outlier Filtering
- **File:** `lib/analysis-service.ts`
- **Issue:** Basic IQR implementation only
- **Impact:** Inaccurate price analysis
- **Fix:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Creating comprehensive stats utility

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Complete Features
- Image upload with drag & drop
- AI vision analysis using OpenAI GPT-4
- User authentication system
- Database integration
- Basic UI components
- Error handling and logging
- Vercel deployment configuration

### 🔄 In Progress
- eBay service real data integration
- Advanced outlier filtering
- Comprehensive testing

### ❌ Missing/Critical
- Real eBay market data
- Production-ready error handling
- Complete test coverage

## Technical Debt

1. **Mock Data Usage:** Extensive use of fallback data in eBay service
2. **Type Safety:** Some components need strict TypeScript compliance
3. **Test Coverage:** Missing unit and integration tests
4. **API Integration:** eBay service not properly integrated with ScraperAPI

## Next Steps Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
1. ✅ Fix environment configuration
2. 🔄 Complete eBay service rewrite
3. 🔄 Implement outlier filtering
4. Remove all mock data

### Phase 2: Quality Assurance (Week 2)
1. Add comprehensive tests
2. Fix TypeScript strict mode issues
3. Performance optimization
4. Security audit

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Week 3)
1. End-to-end testing
2. Documentation updates
3. Deployment testing
4. Client handover preparation

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Level | Issue | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|-------|--------|------------|
| 🔴 Critical | Mock data usage | Client cannot use system | Immediate rewrite of eBay service |
| 🔴 Critical | API key exposure | Security breach | ✅ Fixed - environment cleanup |
| 🟡 High | Missing outlier filtering | Inaccurate analysis | Implement comprehensive stats |
| 🟡 High | Incomplete testing | Quality issues | Add test coverage |
| 🟢 Low | TypeScript compliance | Code quality | Fix strict mode issues |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All mock data removed from eBay service
- [ ] Real ScraperAPI integration working
- [ ] Outlier filtering implemented
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Production deployment successful

## Estimated Completion

**Current Status:** 60% Complete  
**Estimated Completion:** 2-3 weeks  
**Critical Path:** eBay service rewrite  

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Complete eBay service rewrite with ScraperAPI
2. **Short-term:** Implement comprehensive outlier filtering
3. **Medium-term:** Add test coverage and fix TypeScript issues
4. **Long-term:** Performance optimization and monitoring

---

**Note:** This project has strong foundations but requires immediate attention to critical eBay data integration issues before it can be considered client-ready.
